# <<WARNING:>> Potential non fixed positive shape alignment with the host CAD system exists.
#              Allegro PCB Router does not perform any operations to remove or identify slivers and isolations.
#              If the host CAD system performs such an operation, the user may experience unrouted
#              or DRC alignment issues.
#              The user must perform final unrouted/DRC validation within the host CAD system.
